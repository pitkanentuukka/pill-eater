# pill-eater

This was an android game I started years ago. The idea is to control the player by tilting the phone, eat pills and avoid hitting walls. This never got finished, it turned out to be a little too ambitious for one person. For instance, I realized I'd need to write a level editor, which I also had to start over several times. 

This was written in java using AndEngine, which internally uses box2d physics library.
